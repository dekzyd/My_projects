# Welcome to My Select Query
My select Query
## Task
The Task is to create a class with a constructor and where method that searches for an item in a csv file. 
## Description
I approached the problem by spillting the csv into rows and further into colums.
I then checked if the criteria was present in the row.

## Installation
This is a class object and should be used as a datatype

## Usage
data = MySelectQuery.new(csv)
data.where(name, criteria)
