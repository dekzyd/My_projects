# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The task is to replicate my mastermind game with C language

## Description
I solved it by giving the user the option of choosing the code and attempts they need, or having it automatically generated before starting the game and 
checking each digit entered if it exists in the code and also returning output to the user, telling them how close they are to finding the code


## Installation
It is run as an executable on the command line.

## Usage
it can be used by running the executable on the terminal ./my_mastermind -[ct][code]
